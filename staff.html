    <p>Here at Baker's Soccer Camp our staff and coachs are very dedicated
        to teaching our young children not only the basic skills to play soccer, they
        also teach the children life lessons. They teach the children what its like to be
        on a team and what it takes to work together. Most of our coachs and staff have
        full time job since the camp is only open a few ours a day. Combined our coachs
        have over 55 years in either teaching or coaching our young children. They
        that is unmatched in the community.
