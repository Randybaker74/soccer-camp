<h1>Learn the Fundamentals of Soccer</h1>


<h3>There are fundamental skills that need to be learned in soccer. At Baker's Soccer Camp,
    our youth soccer camp aims to teach kids all of the following fundamentals:</h3>

<h2>Passing</h2> 


    <p>Soccer is about teamwork. Passing is the most fundamental soccer skill, as it’s how the
        ball moves around the field. At soccer camp, kids will learn how to effectively pass the
        ball to each other. Your child will first learn how to do a short pass, and then once
        they’ve mastered this, long passes will then be taught. Passing skills include:</p>

    
        <ul>
            <li>Body coordination</li>
            <li>Proximity and speed skills</li>
            <li>Team placement awearness</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>Children will also learn how to receive a pass from another player. This will include ground 
        passes and air travel passes. Learning how to receive a pass is what keeps the game in motion.</p>

<h2>Shooting</h2>  

    <p>Shooting is where players learn to shoot for the goal. Goal scoring is a fundamental skill 
        to learn as it’s what wins the game. Shooting skills include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lerning the correct positions</li>
            <li>Accurate foot</li>
            <li>Ball placement</li>
            <li>Team coordination</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Children always enjoy the reward of scoring a goal! Our kids’ sports camp is a great way to 
        learn about this important skill.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    <img src="Assets/images/dribble.jpg" alt="dribbling ball">
    <h2>Dribbling</h2> 

    <p>Dribbling is how a player moves the ball up the field. Children will learn how to dribble 
        the ball while defending the ball against the opposite team. This involves coordination 
        training and movement perception. Dribbling will also improve kid’s fitness levels drastically. 
        Children will see an increase in their fitness levels over a short space of time.</p>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <img src="Assets/images/goalie.jpg" alt="Goalkeeping">
        <h2>Goalkeeping</h2> 
    
    <p>The final fundamental is learning to defend the goal areas. Goal Defense is a skill that 
        all players need to learn. Children will be taught to read the opponent’s reactions, and 
        how to respond to these. A more specialized skill is learning the position of goalkeeper. 
        We will teach them how to defend, dive, and direct the ball back into play</p>
